# pdf-split-color-bw

Splits a PDF into two PDFs with color and bw pages

**Note:** This was a quick and dirty solution to printing my master thesis and having to
split the color and black&white pages for printer requirement reasons. I am
probably not going to spend anymore time on this, let me know if there is any
issues running these functions.

## Usage

Requires `pdftk`

1. Source the file: `source pdf-split.bash`
2. Execute either function with filename as an argument.
